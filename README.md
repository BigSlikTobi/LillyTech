# LillyTech

LillyTech is an innovative iOS application that breaks down language barriers through real-time voice translation. Using WebRTC technology, it enables seamless communication between users speaking different languages, making global conversations as natural as talking to someone in your native tongue.

## Current Development Status

### What's Ready âœ…

We've established a robust foundation for the application, starting with a well-organized repository structure and comprehensive project architecture. Our logging system, built on Apple's OSLog, provides detailed insights into the application's behavior, making debugging and monitoring straightforward and efficient.

The crown jewel of our current implementation is the Audio Session Management system. Think of it as a sophisticated traffic controller for your device's audio. When you're on a call and receive another call, or when you plug in your headphones, or switch to your car's Bluetooth - our AudioSessionManager handles all these scenarios seamlessly. It works behind the scenes to ensure your voice translation continues smoothly regardless of what's happening with your device.

Key Components:
- **AudioSessionManager**: Handles audio routing and session management
- **AudioSessionState**: Monitors and manages audio states reactively
- **RTCAudioBuffer**: Provides thread-safe audio buffer management
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for audio components

### What We're Building ðŸš§

1. WebRTC Integration
   - STUN/TURN server configuration
   - Real-time communication setup
   - Peer connection management

2. Translation Engine
   - Audio stream processing pipeline
   - Real-time translation service
   - Language detection and selection

3. User Interface
   - Intuitive controls for audio management
   - Real-time status indicators
   - Settings configuration

## Technical Foundation

Built for iOS 15.0+ with:
- WebRTC (via stasel/WebRTC)
- OSLog for system-integrated logging
- Combine for reactive programming
- SwiftUI for modern UI
